title: Introduzione a GitHub Pages come piattaforma per il blogging
---

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) permette di utilizzare GitHub come piattaforma di blogging gratuita: attraverso il motore di [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) i post, scritti in markdown, vengono renderizzati in html e quindi resi disponibili per la fruizione.

Per saperne di più, date una letta [qui](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).

### Setup di Github Pages

Direi che non esiste niente di più semplice:

1. Si crea un repository del tipo nomeutente.github.io

   <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/GitHub-Pages-Intro/GitHub-Pages-Intro-01.png"/>

2. Una volta creato il repository, si sceglie un modo per clonarlo (git, GitHub Desktop, GitHub for Mac)

3.  
Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **☰** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
